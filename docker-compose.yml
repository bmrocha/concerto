      # Exclude vendor/bundle from the volume mount so the container's installed gems are used
      # or we need to ensure the volume doesn't override it. 
      # Since the Dockerfile installs to vendor/bundle inside the image, mounting . over it 
      # will HIDE the installed gems if vendor/bundle is not also a volume.
      # However, the Dockerfile has RUN commands that install gems. 
      # If we mount ., we shadow the built files.
      # Best practice for development is to use a named volume for vendor/bundle.
